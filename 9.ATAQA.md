## Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Analysis

<p>
Algorithmic trading involves using computer programs to execute trading strategies based on predefined criteria, such as price, volume, and timing. This automated approach aims to remove human emotion and make trading more systematic and efficient. Quantitative analysis, on the other hand, involves using mathematical and statistical models to identify profitable trading opportunities. It utilizes historical data, financial metrics, and other factors to create and optimize trading strategies.
